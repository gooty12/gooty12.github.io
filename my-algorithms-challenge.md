## What is this?
The challenge is to solve one algorithmic problem per day.
Unlike my [fitness challenge]({{site.baseurl}}{%link my-fitness-challenge.md%}),
this doesn't have a strict start and end date. It just happened without even
realizing. I never enforced it strictly, but still I solved a lot of
problems in the past 6 months and certainly want to continue it. The goal here
is to keep improving everyday and as long as possible.

## Motivation behind

As part of my ongoing fitness challenge, I workout every single day. I noticed
that my workouts (including the journey to and from gym) were consuming more than
two hours of my day. In order to be more productive, I decided to use the spare
time - rest time between exercises, commute time, etc - to do something mentally. 
I figured solving algorithms would be really fun and mentally challenging. Thus
began this fun activity.

Although it started like this, slowly, I found myself solving problems whenever
I had some spare time in the day. After few weeks, I decided to allocate some time
every day so that I can solve at least one problem. Since then I have been doing
this regularly if not daily.

## What's going on

Currently, I'm solving [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) medium and hard problems. LeetCode problems
closely resemble interview questions. In fact, companies like Google recommend
practising on LeetCode as part of preparation for their interviews. Although my
goal has never been interview preparation, I decided to solve 100 problems of
each category - easy, medium and hard - from LeetCode as it seemed like a
systematic approach to mastering competitive coding.

Here's a quick summary the problems I solved:
1. Solved __100 easy__ and __50+ medium__ problems on LeetCode. In the next two
months it should be 100 easy, 100 medium and 100 hard.
2. Solved __60-70__ Topcoder Division-2 Level-2 problems. These correspond to
LeetCode's easy problems.
3. I've also solved most of the DP, Greedy and graph problems from Steven Skiena's
[Algorithms Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/) book. Another
great source to practice problems from.

You can find the solutions to these problems [here](https://github.com/gooty12/CodeMastery/tree/master/Topcoder)
and [here](https://github.com/gooty12/LeetCode).

There is a lot scope for improvement. Here are a few
things that I need to work on in order to become an effective problem-solver:
1. I have to learn to __keep__ my code __simple__. Although I got better at this,
I'm still no where near the top-ranked coders. Simple and less code is always
easy to debug. The lesser the time spent on debugging the higher the
number problems you can solve during competitions. Coming up with elegant and 
simple algorithms to a problem significantly reduces implementation complexity.

2. Too often I misinterpret the question, forget the constraints, assume things
not mentioned, or ignore edge cases. It's frustrating to the core. It all shows a
lack of focus and attention to detail. Both are fundamental to any kind of
problem solving not just algorithms.

3. Everyone runs into __debugging__ mode one time or the other. You've to be
skillful in order to pinpoint the root cause. Practice helps a lot.
