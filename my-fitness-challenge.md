## What's the challenge?

The challenge is to workout for more than six days a week for two years. More
precisely, to workout 6.5 out of 7 days (on average) in a week. Initially, I
wondered how can one possibly be so consistent for so long, but fast forward to
today, I did better than that - worked out __every single day__ for an year now.
There've been new year celebrations, assignment deadlines, interviews, parties
and a dozen Indian festivals in this period but nothing stopped me from making
it to gym. I'm extremely happy and slightly proud about that!

## Motivation behind
I had already been a regular at my gym for almost 18 months by the time I started
this challenge. During this period I've noticed a lot of change in me. I started
eating clean, consumed lots of fruits and vegetables, developed a strict daily
routine, lost a lot of weight, looked fit and slim, became more driven,
hardworking and disciplined. In a way my entire lifestyle changed. So, when I
moved to the US for my graduate school, I did not want to give up on my workouts
no matter how hectic life could be in grad-school. I revisited my priorities and
set fitness and health at the very top. Now, it was time to act accordingly and
thus the challenge was born. It started on __19th August 2017__ and will continue
for two years. The goal of this challenge is simple - push beyond all my limits.

## What's going on?

Initially, I maintained an online journal that I updated everyday but soon that
felt too much to manage and there wasn't much to write every single day. So, I
decided to post updates only when I've something to talk about. The rest of
this page is all about this.

A quick status on my current fitness levels:
1. I can run around 5.6 to 6 miles in an hour without a break. That's slow! I 
have to improve it to 8 miles/hour.
2. I can hold the plank for 5 minutes.
3. I can do [INSANITY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTEDDmCjd1k) workouts. As the name suggests, they're insane. Anyone
who's looking for peak fitness should try this programme. 

A quick list of things I've learnt in this journey:

1. __Discipline__ is the single biggest reason I could continue this challenge.
There have been days where the simple act of getting off the bed seemed 
impossible, yet somehow I forced myself to the gym. Discipline is doing
the thing that you don't want to but have to. I've learned this and applied the
same to other aspects of my life but I'm far away from mastering it.

2. __Keeping it simple__  is the most effective strategy. 
[George Sheehan](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=george+sheehan&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8),
the running guru says you're doomed if you think anything beyond your next step
while running. [Virat Kohli](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=virat+kohli&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8),
Steve Jobs and many people talk about keeping things simple. It used to sound 
nothing more than like a cliche, but not anymore. Just like discipline, I apply
it all the time especially when it comes to materialistic things.

3. __Hardwork__ is not something I've learnt because of this, but it's the
attitude towards hardwork that has changed. I've always loathed hardwork and
kept strict boundaries when it came to what I can and cannot do. Not anymore!. I've
understood that *genius* is a myth and stopped delegating hardwork. I don't
complain. I love and appreciate hardwork. I motivate myself with my daily
workouts.

### 07/04/2018
I've shifted my focus to running. I've always considered running and cardio
to be the ultimate test to fitness and stamina. I want to see how far I can go.
According to current plan, I will focus on running until the winter and then
shift to weight training again.
