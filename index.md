\[ __Note:__ I'm graduating in May/19 and looking for full-time software developer
postions. I know to program in Java, Haskell, Go, C/C++ and familiar with
Scala, Python. I've strong foundations in Programming languages (thanks
to these [two](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/cs6963/) [courses](https://pubweb.eng.utah.edu/~cs5510/)) 
and can pick up any new language in a week
or two. Also,  I've read and reasoned about the internals and intricacies of
many classic distributed systems (in this [course](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~stutsman/cs6450/calendar/))
and can confidently
say that I can learn anything new in this domain. Finally, I would love
to work in a highly driven and challenging environment. The harder
the challenge the better! \]

Hi, I'm Vinod. I'm a second year masters student at the University of Utah,
[School of Computing department](http://www.cs.utah.edu/). Previously, I did my bachelors in Computer
Science at [National Institute of Technology, Calicut](http://www.nitc.ac.in/). In between, I worked for
two years as a software developer at Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bangalore. I come from a
[small town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guntakal) in southern part of India.


### My Fitness Challenge:
I've an ongoing, self-assigned, fitness challenge that entails working out for more than __six days__ (6.5
out of 7 on average)  a week for the next two years. It's been almost an year, and I haven't missed a single day. In short, I'm
more committed to fitness than to anything else in life right now. See [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}
 {% link my-fitness-challenge.md %}) for more on this.

### Coding and Algorithm challenge:
Inspired by my fitness challenge and applying the same discipline, I've (unknowingly) ended up
with another challenge too - __solve an algorithm a day__. Although never strictly enforced, I did a lot of
competitive coding in the past six months. See [this page]({{site.baseurl}}
{% link my-algorithms-challenge.md %}) for more details.

### Projects:
- **Extended Hyperwall:** Hypervisor is a software that runs directly on hardware
and manages all the virtual machines running above it. Hyperwall, proposed in
literature, is a hardware support for hypervisors to enhance the security of
virtual machines. Extended Hyperwall augments Hyperwall and prevents rollback
based attacks on the VMs. We have designed Extended Hyperwall and simulated its
functionality in the software using _Xen Hypervisor_ kernel. 
- **Mini Java Compiler:** Mini-Java is a subset of Java language. Mini-Java
compiler uses JavaCC's lexer and parser tools and the generated
machine code is run on SPIM that simulates MIPS architecture. The compiler is
built in 5 stages : Lexical analysis, Parsing, Typechecking, Intermediate code
generation, Register allocation.
- **XOS Operating System:** XOS(Experimental Operating System) is a simple OS
kernel that supports all the basic functionalities of an OS like process
scheduling, memory management(virtual memory), interrupts, exceptions and
system calls like fork, exec, read, write, open, close, etc.
